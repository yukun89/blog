#configure

# ~/.zshrc
Q: How the config file works?

~/.zshrc  Set some EVN: PATH, ZSH, 
		  Load	file :oh-my-zsh.sh

So, the main function is in oh-my-zsh.sh. 

# what oh-my-zsh.sh do?

* Check for updates on initial load...
* set ZSH_CUSTOME
* set ZSH_CACHE_DIR
* load config files and custom configurations
* ...
* Load all the plugin
* Load the theme

Now we know that: the point comes to plugin and theme.

# What the plugin do ?
There are many plugins for python, coffee and so on.

# whar the theme do?
